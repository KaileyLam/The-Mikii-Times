                    <p>From a young age, I have been an eyewitness to the remarkable skill and dedication with which my family has crafted hangers for a living. This unique profession has piqued my curiosity, leading me to research into the world of hanger making and explore the familial love hidden in my family's livelihood.</p>

                    <h2>From wires to hangers</h2>
                    <h3>Step 1: Pay-off machine</h3>
                    <p>This pay-off machine is a horizontal pay-off machine, also known as a wire winding machine. It consists of two parts: motor and a storage frame. And it is mainly used for wire take-up, pay-off, storage lines, and the like. In general, this type of machine is directly determined by the diameter of the take-up reel.</p>
                    <p>This machine is the first machine to make hangers and has a simple structure. Although it does not have much technical content, it is also an indispensable part of the hanger production line.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Shaping</h3>
                    <p>The hanger machine will press the wire first to ensure that the wire will not be twisted in the manufacturing process. The wire is cut at the end of the machine and folded into the shape of a hanger with pliers. Finally, hangers are refined and polished. </p>
                    <p>The raw materials for making hangers can be various materials such as wire, aluminum wire, 201 stainless steel wire, etc. Currently, our family only provide aluminum materials, so other materials requires customers to order beforehand.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Packaging and Sale</h3>
